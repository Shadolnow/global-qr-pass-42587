## Entry Gate Best Practices

### Single Staff Member:
- Hold phone in one hand
- Tap blue button for each guest
- Point at their phone screen
- Let them through on green ✅

### Multiple Lines:
- Each staff member uses their own device
- All scanning happens in parallel
- No conflicts, no slowdowns

### Express Mode:
- Keep the scanner page open
- Just keep tapping the blue button
- Point → Validate → Next!
- Can process 1 person every 3-5 seconds

## Troubleshooting

**"Camera not opening?"**
- Refresh the page once
- Make sure Safari has camera permission
- Try tapping the blue button again

**"QR not detected?"**
- Make sure QR code fills most of the frame
- Ensure guest's screen brightness is high
- Hold steady for 1 second

## Desktop/Android Alternative

On non-iOS devices, the old "Start Camera" live scanning still works perfectly!
Choose whatever works best for your device.
