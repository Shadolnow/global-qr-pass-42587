## 🔍 Why This Happens

Your localhost proxies API calls to Vercel production:
```
localhost:8080/api/send-otp → https://eent-tix.vercel.app/api/send-otp
```

The API code is correct, but Vercel needs the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable to send emails.

## ✅ Expected Result

After fix:
1. Beautiful OTP email arrives in inbox
2. Enter 6-digit code
3. Email verified ✅
4. Can claim ticket or proceed to payment
