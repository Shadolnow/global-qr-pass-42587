## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Testing Mode Restriction

Your Resend API key is in **TESTING MODE**, which means:

### ✅ What Works:
- Emails can be sent to: **`eventix.now@gmail.com`** ONLY
- Perfect for development and testing
- No costs incurred

### ❌ What Doesn't Work (Yet):
- Cannot send to other email addresses
- Public users won't receive OTP emails

### 🔓 How to Fix (Enable Production Mode):

#### Option 1: Verify Your Domain (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://resend.com/domains
2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Add your domain (e.g., `eent-tix.vercel.app` or custom domain)
4. Follow DNS verification steps
5. Wait for verification (5-10 minutes)
6. **Done!** Can now send to ANY email address

#### Option 2: Request Production Access
1. Go to: https://resend.com/settings
2. Look for "Remove testing restrictions"
3. Follow the verification process
4. Usually approved within 24 hours

## 🔓 Upgrading to Production Mode

### Why Verify a Domain?
- ✅ Better email deliverability
- ✅ Custom sender email (noreply@yourdomain.com)
- ✅ No "via resend.dev" in email client
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Send to unlimited recipients

### Which Domain to Verify?

**Option A: Vercel Domain (Quick)**
- Domain: `eent-tix.vercel.app`
- Free, already yours
- Setup time: 5-10 minutes
- DNS records: Add to Vercel dashboard

**Option B: Custom Domain (Best)**
- Domain: `yourdomain.com`
- Most professional
- Requires owning a domain
- DNS records: Add to your domain registrar
