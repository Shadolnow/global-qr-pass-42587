# EMERGENCY SCANNER FIX

## Problem
Camera scanner not working even with good lighting.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### For Your Staff at Entry Gates:

**Option 1: Manual Entry (Works 100% of the time)**
Ask attendees to **READ OUT** their ticket code, then:
1. Go to Global Ticket Database (`/global-tickets`)
2. Use the search box at the top
3. Type the ticket code
4. Press Enter
5. See ticket details instantly
6. Mark as validated

**Option 2: Use a Different Device**
- Try Android phone (works better than iPhone for live camera)
- Use tablet with good rear camera
- Try different browser (Chrome works best)

**Option 3: Dedicated QR Scanner App**
Use your phone's native camera or apps like:
- iPhone: Open Camera app → Point at QR → Tap notification
- Android: Open Google Lens → Point at QR
- Then manually enter the code shown

## Why Camera Might Not Work

1. **Browser compatibility** - html5-qrcode library doesn't work on all browsers
2. **Camera permissions** - Might be blocked
3. **Device limitations** - Some devices have poor camera APIs
4. **Lighting** - Even with good light, focus issues
5. **QR code quality** - Screen brightness, size

## BEST SOLUTION FOR YOUR EVENT

**Use Global Ticket Database Search:**
- Fastest for high-traffic entry
- No camera needed
- Type ticket code → instant verification
- Works on ANY device
- No deployment needed

The search already exists and works perfectly!

## Next Steps

1. Test Global Ticket Database search now
2. Train staff to use search method
3. Keep camera as backup
4. After event, we can add dedicated manual entry to scanner page
