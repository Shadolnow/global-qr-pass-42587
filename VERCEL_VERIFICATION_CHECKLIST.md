## 🔧 Common Issues & Fixes:

### Issue 1: "Failed to send OTP" Error
**Cause**: Environment variables not deployed yet
**Fix**: Redeploy in Vercel (wait 1-2 min)

### Issue 2: Email Not Received
**Cause**: Testing mode restriction
**Fix**: Use `eventix.now@gmail.com` as recipient

### Issue 3: Supabase Errors
**Cause**: VITE_ variables not set correctly
**Fix**: Double-check `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Issue 4: Page Not Loading
**Cause**: Frontend Supabase vars missing
**Fix**: Ensure both `VITE_` prefixed variables are added
